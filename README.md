# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived
the Titanic disaster based on demographic and ticket information.

## Dataset
The dataset includes passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class,
fare, and embarkation port.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Logistic Regression model training
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
- Accuracy: ~81%
- The model performs better at predicting non-survivors than survivors

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells.
